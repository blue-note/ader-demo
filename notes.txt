    His code
        filter sets
            
            
Key Questions:
    How does he know which 3rd party URLS are bad vs good?  
        - checks the parent frame 
        - blocking filter list 
            
            
Notes:
    When browser sees a URL, it requests from it 
    Implement a whitelist 
    bad words:
        ad 
        sponsor 
        random 
    
    
check every hour: 
    var that = this;
  if (newUser)
    this.checkFilterUpdates();
  else
    idleHandler.scheduleItemOnce(
      function() { 
        that.checkFilterUpdates();
      },
      60
    );
    
    window.setInterval(
    function() { 
      idleHandler.scheduleItemOnce(function() {
        that.checkFilterUpdates();
      });
    }, 
    60 * 60 * 1000
  );
  
  Giant white space and a lot of recurrsions. 
  How to make the ads get blocked once and for good.
  What did I change, that makes them refresh constantly 
    Not from turning all non-scripts to swap vs CSS hiding.
    Letting it loop cuts it from 50 to 27
    Not from swapping the SRC of the IMG
        It's probably because for some reason redirecting 
        the URL to the picture simply makes it reload. 
        Not from about:blank 
    
Problems: 
    IMG[src$="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/activeview?...
    
Notes:
    0. If adblock is paused, escape 
    00. If frameData can't track it, escape
    01. If the framedomain is whitelisted, escape 
    1. If it's blocked, and an image, subdoc, or object
                    - Change the way it looks
    2. If it's a blocked subdocument, redirect the URL 
    3. If it's a blocked image, redirect url to small extension img
    4. If it's blocked, increment counter 
    5. IF IT'S ANYTHING ELSE, CANCEL BLOCKED??!  
    
    
The sonic jpeg can't be read by the browser. 
But I think HTML can be. I'll try redirecting it to a local thing.
